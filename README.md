# ionic-vue-deeplinks-demo
A simple demo app with a very basic configuration to enable Deep Links on your Ionic Vue app.

# Why
Most of the documentation, demo and code snippets for Ionic is for the Angular version. That's why I decided to upload this very basic demo, to help everyone that have my same necessities.

# Details
You can find on the Capacitor website the documentation, [here](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/guides/deep-links). The app is already working for their demo website. The configuration can be found on App.vue file. Plus you can modify and change the basic configuration to meet your necessities.
